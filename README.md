# OpenFOAM v2006 Utility Toolkit

**A personal collection of utility functions and scripts for OpenFOAM v2006, designed to simplify and automate various CFD tasks.**

This repository gathers a set of custom tools developed to improve efficiency in setting up, running, and post-processing OpenFOAM simulations. It is primarily targeted at users of OpenFOAM v2006, though parts of the toolkit may be compatible with other versions.

> ⚠️ Most tools are written in Python 3 and Bash. Use with OpenFOAM v2006 is recommended.

## Features

- Read motion data (e.g., acceleration, force, and torque) from external files
- Calculate fluid volume in arbitrary (irregular) regions
- Move or transform mesh based on attitude matrices and translation vectors
- Shell scripts for batch file transfer and automated case operations
